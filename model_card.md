## Intended use
**Primary intended uses**
The primary use of Alpaca-CNNDailymail is research on instruction following large language models on text summarization task.

**Primary intended users**
The primary intended users of the model are researchers in natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

**Out-of-scope use cases**
Alpaca-CNNDailymail models are not intended for use in production systems.

## Metrics
**Model performance measures**
N/A

**Approaches to uncertainty and variability**
We have only finetuned a single Alpaca-CNNDailymail model at each model size, and thus we do not have a good sense of the variability of the model.

## Evaluation datasets
The model was evaluated on CNN-Dailymail test set.

## Training dataset
The model was trained on CNN-Dailymail training set.
